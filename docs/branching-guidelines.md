## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To maintain a clean, professional, and scalable GitHub repository, we follow a simple but powerful branching strategy.

All contributors (including project maintainers) must create branches systematically before starting any new work.

## ðŸ“š Branching Rules

âœ… Always branch from `main`.

âœ… Use clear, lowercase, hyphen-separated names.
